# Jet Engine Performance Calculator

## Overview

This project simulates the performance of a jet engine by calculating thrust, fuel consumption, and thermal efficiency based on user-defined parameters. The tool uses NASA’s open-source atmospheric models to ensure accuracy and includes a real-time graphical display of engine performance.

## Features

**User-Friendly GUI** – Enter altitude, velocity, and mass flow rate to compute jet engine performance.

**Live Graphing** – Displays thrust, fuel consumption, and efficiency in real-time.

**Realistic Calculations** – Uses NASA atmospheric data for accurate pressure and temperature.

**Customizable Inputs** – Adjust values to see how different conditions affect engine performance.

## Installation

Install python, numpy, matplotlib, and tkinter
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tkinter
```

## Usage

Run the script using:
```bash
python jet_performance_gui.py
```

## Input Parameters

**Altitude (m):** Flight altitude above sea level.

**Inlet Velocity (m/s):** Speed of air entering the engine.

**Exhaust Velocity (m/s):** Speed of exhaust gases leaving the engine.

**Mass Flow Rate (kg/s):** The amount of air passing through the engine.

## Output:

**Thrust (N):** The force generated by the engine.

**Fuel Consumption (kg/s):** The fuel burned per second.

**Thermal Efficiency (%):** The efficiency of the engine’s energy conversion.

**Atmospheric Temperature (K) & Pressure (Pa):** Environmental conditions at the given altitude.
